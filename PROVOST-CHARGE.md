## Letter of Appointment and Charge

Dear Colleagues,

Artificial intelligence, in its traditional forms as well as its more recent generative form, has the potential to transform our educational enterprise in ways we are beginning to imagine. We have much to imagine still for its impacts, and its opportunities, for how we teach, how we learn, and how we launch the learner-leaders of tomorrow towards their exciting future.

Our campus is known for interdisciplinary collaborations in education, creating unique and high-value blended degrees, and providing transformative educational experiences for our students. The moment is right to leverage this collaborative spirit in conjunction with our deep and broad expertise in AI, putting us in a great position to lead the nation in educating our students in AI.

The campus is advancing on the development of a comprehensive AI education strategy and implementation across our colleges and units. The initiatives include, but are not limited to:

1. Facilitating and supporting regular structured conversations on a broad range of AI topics
2. Supporting our instructors to infuse AI concepts and usage in their courses
3. Supporting the development of general education elective courses in AI
4. Supporting the development and launch of AI certificates
5. Developing a campus-wide AI minor
6. Developing blended X+AI (or AI+X) degrees

Creating meaningful, lasting, and rigorous transcriptable credentials require careful consideration of learning outcomes, course and curriculum design, and resource allocation. In the AI space, consideration must also be given to whether students will approach AI as a tool within a discipline, or a discipline on its own. The educational background and prerequisite knowledge of the broad swath of learners that would want to engage in earning these credentials also must be taken into consideration.

On behalf of the Office of the Provost and Deans Bashir, Bollero, Chodzko-Zajko, Elliott, Knox, Mouza, Patton, and Stewart, I am pleased to appoint and charge each of you as members of the Campus AI Curriculum Task Force.

## Specific Charges to the Committee

We specifically request that your committee address the following:

### 1. Campus-Wide Undergraduate AI Minor

Articulate the framework for the development of a campus-wide undergraduate AI minor that could be available to all students at the University.

**Questions to Address**:
- What would be the learning objectives?
- What specific courses would be required?
- What resources are needed for this minor?
- When could such a minor be launched?
- Where should it be housed?

### 2. Blended X+AI (or AI+X) Degree Model

Leveraging our success in developing and offering blended degrees, what would a blended X+AI (or AI+X) undergraduate degree model look like on our campus?

**Questions to Address**:
- What would the AI core look like?
- How do we learn from our CS+X and X+DS models to formulate these future X+AI degrees?
- How would such a degree differ from a campus-wide AI minor?
- What are the administrative and financial considerations for such blended degrees?
- Would there be a benefit to a centralized structure to manage multi-college X+AI degrees?

### 3. Stackable AI Certificate

Incorporate the development of a campus-wide undergraduate AI certificate that would be stackable into the AI minor and blended X+AI (or AI+X) offerings.

### 4. Scalable Delivery Model

Give consideration to an accessible and scalable delivery model for coursework offered in the AI minor and the +AI (or AI+) components of a blended degree model.

**Questions to Address**:
- What delivery modes would work best (online, hybrid, in-person)?
- How can we ensure accessibility for diverse student populations?
- What are the administrative and financial considerations for a scalable model?

### 5. Graduate Education Transfer

In developing a blended X+AI (or AI+X) degree model, give consideration to how that model could be transferred to graduate education.

### 6. Ethics and Societal Concerns

Consider how social, ethical, environmental, and economic concerns should be integrated into these programs.
