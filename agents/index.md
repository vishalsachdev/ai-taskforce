# Research Agent Documentation

This research employed a **hierarchical swarm of 6 specialized AI agents** working in parallel under human orchestration. Each agent focused on a distinct research domain, executing deep research independently while contributing to coordinated synthesis.

**Infrastructure**: Powered by [Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)
**Methodology**: AI-assisted research with human steering
**Execution**: Parallel research over 1 day (November 23, 2025)

## Integration & Synthesis

These six agents worked **in parallel** but within a **coordinated framework**:

1. **Simultaneous execution** - no sequential dependencies
2. **Standardized protocols** - web search, source validation, evidence-based analysis
3. **Structured outputs** - executive summaries, detailed findings, recommendations, citations
4. **Cross-referencing** - Agent Gamma's peer benchmarks informed Agent Alpha's UIUC positioning

**Human orchestration** ensured:
- Research design aligned with Provost charges
- Agent coordination and progress monitoring
- Synthesis validation for logical consistency
- Strategic framing for institutional context
- Quality assurance across all findings

## Research Quality Assurance

### Source Diversity
- **200+ sources** across six domains
- **Primary sources**: Official university documents, program catalogs, strategic plans
- **Academic standards**: ACM/IEEE/AAAI guidelines, peer-reviewed research
- **Government frameworks**: UNESCO, EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple sources for critical claims

### Evidence-Based Recommendations
- **Every recommendation traced** to specific evidence
- **Quantitative data**: Enrollment numbers, credit requirements, financial projections
- **Comparative analysis**: Peer university data, not assumptions

### Stakeholder Alignment
- Agent Beta profiling ensured recommendations matched task force expertise
- College priorities incorporated (Gies stackable credentials, LAS equity focus)

### Financial Realism
- Conservative enrollment projections (80% of optimistic targets)
- Multi-year sustainability pathway
- Resource requirements specified (FTE, infrastructure, space)
