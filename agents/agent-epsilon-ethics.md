- Topics: Philosophical frameworks, core concepts, case studies
- Format: Discussion-based, stakeholder analysis, ethical reasoning
- Faculty: Co-taught (CS + Philosophy + Law + Sociology)

**Component 2: Embedded Modules (Throughout Technical Curriculum)**
- ML Course: Algorithmic bias, fairness metrics, bias mitigation (15-20% of content)
- NLP Course: Language model bias, cultural sensitivity, misinformation
- Computer Vision: Facial recognition ethics, surveillance concerns
- Robotics: Autonomous systems ethics, safety, accountability

**Component 3: Interdisciplinary Electives (Optional)**
- AI & Law (legal liability, regulation, intellectual property)
- AI & Public Policy (governance frameworks, policy analysis)
- AI & Social Justice (equity, inclusion, power dynamics)
- AI & Environmental Sustainability (Green AI, carbon accounting)

**Evidence**: Programs using hybrid approach (Stanford, Harvard, MIT) show higher ethical awareness and better integration of ethics into technical decision-making.

### Core Ethics Topics with Teaching Frameworks

#### 1. Algorithmic Bias & Fairness

**Key Concepts**:
- **Sources of Bias**: Training data, feature selection, algorithm design, deployment context
- **Fairness Metrics**: Demographic parity, equalized odds, predictive parity, calibration
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Debiasing datasets, fairness constraints, adversarial debiasing
- **Limitations**: No universal fairness definition, trade-offs between metrics

**Case Studies for Teaching**:
- Amazon AI recruiting tool (discriminated against women)
- COMPAS recidivism prediction (racial bias concerns)
- Facial recognition (11% higher error rate for darker skin tones)
- Healthcare AI (Obermeyer study showed racial bias in risk scores)

**Hands-On Tools**:
- IBM AI Fairness 360 (70+ fairness metrics, 10+ mitigation algorithms)
- Google What-If Tool (interactive fairness exploration)
- Microsoft Fairlearn (Python library for bias assessment/mitigation)

**Assessment**: Audit existing AI system for bias, propose mitigation strategies, evaluate trade-offs

#### 2. Privacy & Data Rights

**Key Concepts**:
- **Data Collection**: Consent, purpose limitation, data minimization
- **Legal Frameworks**: GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), FERPA (education)
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Differential privacy, federated learning, secure multi-party computation
- **Trade-offs**: Privacy vs. utility, individual vs. collective benefit

**Case Studies**:
- Cambridge Analytica (Facebook data misuse)
- Clearview AI (facial recognition without consent)
- Health data breaches (exposing sensitive information)
- Student data privacy (EdTech surveillance concerns)

**Technical Approaches**:
- Differential privacy implementation
- Federated learning (model training without centralized data)
- Homomorphic encryption (computation on encrypted data)

**Assessment**: Design privacy-preserving AI application, analyze GDPR compliance

#### 3. Transparency & Explainability

**Key Concepts**:
- **Black Box Problem**: Neural networks difficult to interpret
- **XAI Techniques**: LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms, saliency maps
- **Right to Explanation**: EU AI Act, high-risk AI systems
- **Trade-offs**: Interpretability vs. accuracy, complexity vs. trust

**Case Studies**:
- Healthcare diagnostics (doctors need explanations to trust AI)
- Loan decisions (applicants have right to understand rejections)
- Criminal justice (explainability requirements for sentencing recommendations)

**Technical Tools**:
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Grad-CAM (visual explanations for CNNs)
- Anchors (high-precision rule-based explanations)

**Assessment**: Explain complex model to non-technical stakeholders, evaluate explanation quality

#### 4. Accountability & Governance

**Key Concepts**:
- **Responsibility**: Who is accountable when AI fails? Developer, deployer, user?
- **Corporate Governance**: AI ethics boards, oversight committees, whistleblower protections
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: EU AI Act (risk-based regulation), NIST AI RMF (US voluntary framework)
- **Liability**: Product liability, professional malpractice, negligence

**Case Studies**:
- Tesla Autopilot accidents (driver vs. manufacturer responsibility)
- Boeing 737 MAX (automation failures, regulatory capture)
- Uber self-driving car fatality (testing protocols, safety oversight)

**Policy Analysis**:
- EU AI Act: Ban on certain uses, high-risk system requirements
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework: Voluntary guidelines for trustworthy AI
- State-level AI regulation: Illinois Biometric Privacy Act, California CCPA

**Assessment**: Draft AI governance policy for organization, analyze regulatory compliance

#### 5. Environmental Sustainability

**Key Concepts**:
- **Carbon Footprint**: Large model training (GPT-3: 300,000 kg CO2)
- **Energy Consumption**: Data centers, inference at scale
- **Green AI**: Efficiency techniques, model compression, carbon accounting
- **E-Waste**: Hardware obsolescence, rare earth materials

**Shocking Statistics**:
- Training GPT-3 = 300,000 kg CO2 (equivalent to 125 round-trip flights NYC-Beijing)
- Data centers = 1% of global electricity consumption
- AI model size doubling every 3-4 months (exponential growth)

**Green AI Practices**:
- Model efficiency (pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation)
- Carbon-aware computing (train during renewable energy hours)
- Hardware efficiency (specialized chips, efficient architectures)
- Reporting carbon footprint (transparency in model cards)

**Teaching Resources**:
- Green AI paper (Schwartz et al., 2019)
- Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning (Strubell et al., 2019)
- Carbon emissions calculator tools

**Assessment**: Calculate and optimize environmental impact of AI project

#### 6. Economic & Social Impact

**Key Concepts**:
- **Labor Displacement**: Automation of cognitive tasks, job market shifts
- **Skill-Biased Technological Change**: Inequality between AI-skilled and displaced workers
- **Concentration of Power**: Big Tech dominance, barriers to entry
- **Global Inequality**: AI benefits concentrated in Global North

**Economic Analysis**:
- McKinsey: 800M jobs displaced by 2030, 375M workers need skill transitions
- WEF: 85M jobs displaced, 97M new jobs created (net positive but disruption)
- Concentration: 5 companies (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple) dominate AI

**Social Considerations**:
- Digital divide (2.6 billion people lack internet access)
- Cultural bias (AI trained predominantly on English, Western data)
- Power dynamics (who controls AI development and deployment)

**Teaching Approaches**:
- Economic modeling (labor market impacts by sector)
- Scenario planning (best/worst case futures)
- Stakeholder analysis (who benefits, who is harmed)
- Policy proposals (universal basic income, retraining programs, taxation)

**Assessment**: Analyze labor market impacts of AI in specific industry, propose mitigation policies
