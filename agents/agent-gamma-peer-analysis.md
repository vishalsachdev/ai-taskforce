## Key Findings

### AI Minor Adoption Trends

**Overall Pattern**:
- **7 of 12 universities** (58%) offer dedicated AI minors
- **Most launched 2024-2025** (very recent trend - opportunity for UIUC to compete)
- **Credit range**: 15-26 credits (5-7 courses)
- **Universal exclusion**: ALL exclude CS majors from minors (CS majors get concentrations instead)

### Standout Program Models

#### 1. Georgia Tech - Dual-Track Innovation (First in Nation)

**Program**: Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Minor
**Launch**: Summer 2024
**Structure**: 15 credits with TWO separate tracks

**Track 1: Engineering**
- Core: Probability/stats for engineering + AI/ML algorithms for engineering
- 3 electives from engineering schools

**Track 2: Liberal Arts**
- Core: Probability/stats for humanities/social sciences + AI/ML for humanities
- 3 electives from Ivan Allen College

**Key Innovation**:
- Same minor, different curricula based on student background
- Forces interdisciplinary exposure (2 courses outside home school)
- Joint governance (College of Engineering + Ivan Allen College)

**Why It Matters**: First university to formally recognize AI education needs differ for STEM vs. non-STEM students within same credential.

#### 2. Northwestern - Rapid Growth Model

**Program**: Artificial Intelligence Minor
**Launch**: Fall 2024
**Enrollment**: 146 students in first year (exceptional uptake)
**Structure**: 12 units (4 math + 8 CS including 3 upper-level electives)

**Success Factors**:
- Strong marketing campaign before launch
- Clear articulation with CS major
- Requires 4 units unique to minor (prevents double-counting)
- Open to all majors except CS

#### 3. Carnegie Mellon - Ethics Integration Pioneer

**Program**: Artificial Intelligence Minor
**Launch**: Early 2020s
**Structure**: 54 units (6 courses)

**Key Innovation**: Mandatory societal aspects course
- Core: 3 AI courses (Intro, Representation/Problem Solving, ML)
- Technical: 2 electives (vision, speech, robotics)
- **Ethics: 1 required course** (ethics, policy, economics of AI)

**Why It Matters**: CMU led national trend of required ethics coursework in technical AI programs.

#### 4. Penn State - Stackable Credentials Model

**Program**: AI Minor launching 2025
**Structure**: 18 credits
**Launch**: Spring 2025

**Key Innovation**: Certificate → Minor → MS pathway
- Undergraduate certificate leads to minor
- Minor credits articulate to MS programs
- Clear stackability at each level

**Why It Matters**: Demonstrates lifetime learning pathway from certificate through graduate education.

### Universities Without AI Minors (Important Negative Findings)

**MIT**:
- Offers full AI major (Course 6-4) instead of minor
- Focus: Deep technical education for future AI researchers
- Rationale: Minor would dilute technical depth

**Stanford**:
- Graduate/professional certificates only
- MOOCs at massive scale (1.7M+ students in AI courses)
- Rationale: Democratize AI education globally vs. credential locally

**Ohio State**:
- Developing AI Fluency Initiative (mandatory for ALL students by 2029)
- Focus: Universal literacy vs. specialized credential
- Rationale: Every graduate needs AI understanding, not just those pursuing minor

### X+AI Blended Degrees (Emerging Trend)

**Status**: Very few exist yet (cutting-edge opportunity)

**Bowling Green State**:
- First "AI + X" degree launching Fall 2025
- Nationwide first-mover

**MIT**:
- Multiple CS+X majors exist (CS+Economics, Computing+Cognition)
- Proven model but CS-centric (not AI-centric)

**Carnegie Mellon**:
- BXA programs (CS+Arts, Engineering+Arts)
- Interdisciplinary but not AI-specific

**Implication for UIUC**: X+AI space is wide open for leadership. UIUC's CS+X experience positions it to lead nationally.

### Scalable Delivery Models

**MOOC Success**:
- **Stanford AI courses**: 160,000+ students (Andrew Ng, Daphne Koller)
- **Coursera partnerships**: Massive reach, low completion rates
- **Challenge**: Converting awareness to credit-bearing enrollment

**Hybrid Dominance**:
- **68% of universities** increased online offerings since 2020
- **Best practice**: In-person for labs/projects, online for lectures/content
- **Technology**: AI-powered tutoring, automated grading, personalized paths

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- Cloud computing credits (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- GPU access for training models
- Learning management systems with AI integration
- Asynchronous discussion platforms

## Comparative Analysis Tables

### AI Minor Credit Requirements

| University | Credits | Courses | Tracks | Launch |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Georgia Tech | 15 | 5 | Dual | 2024 |
| Northwestern | 12 units | 4 | Single | 2024 |
| CMU | 54 units | 6 | Single | 2020s |
| Michigan (Dearborn) | 26 | 7+ | Single | 2024 |
| Penn State | 18 | 6 | Single | 2025 |
| Purdue | Unknown | Unknown | Single | 2024 |

**Recommendation for UIUC**: 18 credits (6 courses) aligns with median and UIUC's CS+X precedent.

### Administrative Structures

| Model | Universities | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Single Department** | CMU, Northwestern, Purdue | Simple governance, clear ownership | Limited interdisciplinary reach |
| **Multi-College** | Georgia Tech, Michigan | Broader participation, shared resources | Complex coordination |
| **Centralized Institute** | None yet observed | Neutral platform, dedicated resources | Expensive, bureaucratic |
| **Provost Coordination** | (UIUC X+DS model) | College buy-in, distributed delivery | Requires strong central leadership |

**Recommendation for UIUC**: Provost coordination (proven with X+DS) enables multi-college participation without single-college dominance.
