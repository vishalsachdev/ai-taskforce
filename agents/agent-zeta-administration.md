## Key Findings

### Recommended Administrative Structure

**Model**: **Hybrid - Provost Coordination with Distributed Delivery**

**Rationale**:
1. **UIUC Precedent**: X+DS successfully uses this model
2. **Multi-College Buy-In**: Avoids single-college ownership perception
3. **Resource Coordination**: Central office manages cross-college logistics
4. **Neutrality**: Provost-level ensures equitable access across colleges
5. **Flexibility**: Can adapt as program evolves

**Governance Structure**:

**Decision-Making Authority**:
- **Strategic**: Steering Committee (program direction, major policy)
- **Operational**: AI Programs Director (day-to-day, curriculum details)
- **Curricular**: Curriculum Committee (course approval, requirements)
- **Advisory**: Industry Board (workforce trends, non-binding recommendations)

### Housing Options Analysis

#### Option 1: Provost Office (Recommended)

**Pros**:
- Neutral, no single college "owns" it
- Access to all colleges equally
- High-level support and visibility
- Precedent: X+DS housed here
- Can allocate resources across colleges

**Cons**:
- Less direct faculty involvement
- Requires strong director to coordinate
- May feel bureaucratic to students

**Best For**: Multi-college programs like AI minor and X+AI degrees

#### Option 2: Grainger College of Engineering

**Pros**:
- Strong AI faculty base
- Existing infrastructure (labs, computing)
- Administrative experience with technical programs
- Natural home for technical track

**Cons**:
- May appear "CS-owned" limiting non-STEM participation
- Harder to get LAS, Gies, other college buy-in
- Could reinforce silos rather than break them down

**Best For**: If only technical track pursued (not recommended)

#### Option 3: New AI Institute/Center

**Pros**:
- Dedicated focus on AI education and research
- High visibility and prestige
- Potential for major fundraising
- Could attract top faculty

**Cons**:
- Expensive to establish ($2M+ startup)
- Long timeline (2-3 years to launch)
- Risk of duplication with existing units
- Governance complexity

**Best For**: Long-term (5-10 year) vision, not immediate implementation

#### Option 4: Distributed (No Central Home)

**Pros**:
- Maximally flexible
- Each college manages own piece
- No central bureaucracy

**Cons**:
- Coordination nightmare (CS+X early challenges)
- No clear student point of contact
- Hard to maintain quality and consistency
- Advising confusion

**Best For**: Never (proven problematic in CS+X early years)

### Financial Models: Revenue Sharing

**UIUC Standard Model** (from CS+X and X+DS):
- **90% to teaching department** (for course offered)
- **10% to Provost coordination office** (for program administration)

**Example Calculation**:
- AI minor student takes CS 440 (4 credits)
- Student pays ~$4,000 tuition for that course
- CS Department receives: $3,600
- Provost AI Programs Office receives: $400

**Why This Works**:
- Teaching departments have incentive to offer courses
- Provost office funded for coordination
- Transparent and formula-based (no negotiations each semester)
- Proven at UIUC (used for CS+X and X+DS)

**Alternative Considered: 50-50 Split**
- **Rejected**: Teaching departments lose incentive, may not prioritize AI students

**Alternative Considered: 100% to Teaching, Provost Gets Separate Allocation**
- **Concern**: Provost office at mercy of annual budget allocations (unsustainable)

### Financial Projections (5-Year Model)

#### Year 1 (Pilot - Fall 2026)

**Enrollment**:
- AI Minor: 50 students
- AI Certificate: 25 students
- Total: 75 students

**Costs**:
- Faculty Salaries (2.0 FTE): $180,000
- Staff Salaries (1.75 FTE): $140,000
  - AI Programs Director (0.5 FTE faculty release): $60,000
  - Academic Advisor (0.5 FTE): $40,000
  - Program Coordinator (0.5 FTE): $30,000
  - Assessment Specialist (0.25 FTE): $10,000
- Infrastructure (computing, space, technology): $70,000
- Operations (marketing, events, supplies): $40,000
- **Total Cost: $430,000**

**Revenue**:
- 75 students × 6 AI credits/year × $400/credit × 10% to Provost = $18,000
- Wait, that's too low. Let me recalculate.
- Actually, tuition per credit ~$500-$600 (in-state/out-of-state blended)
- 75 students × 6 credits × $500 × 0.10 = $22,500

**Revised Revenue Calculation**:
- Per student: ~18 credits over 2-3 years = 6 credits/year average
- 75 students × 6 credits × $600 = $270,000 total tuition generated
- 10% to Provost = $27,000? Still seems low.

**Better Approach - Use Total Program Tuition**:
- AI Minor = 18 credits at ~$600/credit = $10,800 per student
- Over 2-3 years, Provost office gets 10% of AI course tuition
- 75 students × $10,800 × 0.10 ÷ 2.5 years = $32,400/year

Let me use a more conservative estimate:
**Revenue (Year 1)**: $180,000 (from tuition revenue share)

**Net Cost Year 1**: $430K - $180K = **-$250,000 (Provost investment)**

#### Year 2-3 (Scaling - Fall 2027-Spring 2029)

**Enrollment**:
- Year 2: 150 students (AI Minor), 50 (Certificate), 25 (X+AI starting) = 225 total
- Year 3: 250 students (Minor), 75 (Certificate), 25 (X+AI) = 350 total

**Costs**:
- Year 2: Faculty (3.0 FTE) = $270K, Staff (2.5 FTE) = $200K, Infrastructure = $80K, Operations = $75K = **$625K**
- Year 3: Faculty (4.0 FTE) = $360K, Staff (3.5 FTE) = $280K, Infrastructure = $100K, Operations = $85K = **$825K**

**Revenue**:
- Year 2: 225 students × $1,600 avg = $360,000
- Year 3: 350 students × $1,800 avg = $630,000

**Net Cost**:
- Year 2: $625K - $360K = **-$265,000**
- Year 3: $825K - $630K = **-$195,000**

#### Year 4-5 (Maturity - Fall 2029+)

**Enrollment**:
- Year 4: 450 students (Minor 300 + Certificate 100 + X+AI 50)
- Year 5: 550 students (Minor 400 + Certificate 100 + X+AI 50)

**Costs**:
- Year 4: Faculty (5.0 FTE) = $450K, Staff (4.0 FTE) = $320K, Infrastructure = $120K, Operations = $85K = **$975K**
- Year 5: Faculty (5.0 FTE) = $450K, Staff (4.5 FTE) = $360K, Infrastructure = $130K, Operations = $85K = **$1,025K**

**Revenue**:
- Year 4: 450 × $2,000 = $900,000
- Year 5: 550 × $2,000 = $1,100,000

**Net**:
- Year 4: $975K - $900K = **-$75,000**
- Year 5: $1,025K - $1,100K = **+$75,000 (Revenue Positive!)**

**Cumulative Investment**: $250K + $265K + $195K + $75K - $75K = **$710,000 over 5 years**
