## Research Focus

### Primary Objectives

1. **Map ALL existing AI courses, programs, and certificates** across UIUC colleges
2. **Document the CS+X program model** (structure, governance, outcomes, lessons learned)
3. **Document the X+DS (Data Science) program model** (structure, governance, outcomes)
4. **Identify UIUC AI faculty expertise** across departments
5. **Research UIUC AI research centers, labs, and institutes**
6. **Document current AI-related partnerships** (IBM, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.)
7. **Find UIUC strategic plans mentioning AI education**

### Key Research Questions

- What AI courses currently exist and where are they housed?
- How do CS+X and X+DS programs work administratively?
- What were the challenges and successes of CS+X and X+DS launches?
