# Campus AI Curriculum Task Force Research

**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**
**Research Period**: November 2025
**Task Force Chairs**: Derek Hoiem (Grainger Engineering), Shaowen Wang (LAS)

> **⚠️ Methodological Note**: This is an **experiment in AI-assisted research with human steering**. The research employs coordinated AI agents (powered by [Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)) under human orchestration to achieve breadth and speed without sacrificing rigor. All findings are evidence-based, transparently sourced, and validated by human expertise.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research and recommendations for the [University of Illinois Campus AI Curriculum Task Force](https://provost.illinois.edu/about/committees/education-2/campus-ai-curriculum-task-force/), charged by Provost John Coleman to develop a campus-wide AI education strategy.

### Key Deliverables

- **December 19, 2025**: Short summary update to Provost
- **January 19, 2026**: Full written report with implementation plan

---

## Key Recommendations

### 1. 🎓 AI Minor (18 credits)
Dual-track program launching Fall 2026
- **Technical Track**: STEM students, rigorous algorithms
- **Applications Track**: Non-STEM, accessible prerequisites
- **Pilot**: 50-75 students

### 2. 🔗 X+AI Blended Degrees (30-credit AI core)
Multi-college collaboration launching Fall 2027
- Business+AI, Agriculture+AI, iSchool+AI pilots
- Proven governance model from CS+X experience

### 3. 📜 Stackable AI Certificate (12 credits)
Clear articulation pathway
- Certificate → Minor → X+AI Degree
- Hybrid delivery for accessibility

### 4. 🌐 Scalable Delivery Model
Leverage UIUC's MCS-DS online expertise
- Hybrid: In-person labs + online lectures
- Cloud computing infrastructure

### 5. 🎯 Graduate Transfer Pathways
Direct articulation to MS programs
- AI Minor → MS in CS (AI Specialization): 6-9 credits
- 4+1 accelerated programs

### 6. ⚖️ Ethics Integration
Hybrid model throughout curriculum
- Standalone 3-credit "AI Ethics and Society" course
- Embedded modules in all technical courses
- Interdisciplinary partnerships (Philosophy, Law, Sociology)

## Research Methodology

**This is an experiment in AI-assisted research with human steering.**

We deployed a **hierarchical swarm** of 6 specialized AI agents (powered by [Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)) working in parallel:

1. **[Agent Alpha](agents/agent-alpha-institutional.md)** - UIUC institutional context
2. **[Agent Beta](agents/agent-beta-stakeholders.md)** - Task force member profiling
3. **[Agent Gamma](agents/agent-gamma-peer-analysis.md)** - Peer university analysis (12 institutions)
4. **[Agent Delta](agents/agent-delta-curriculum.md)** - Curriculum & pedagogy frameworks
5. **[Agent Epsilon](agents/agent-epsilon-ethics.md)** - Ethics integration
6. **[Agent Zeta](agents/agent-zeta-administration.md)** - Administrative & financial modeling

**Human Role**: Research design, agent orchestration, synthesis validation, strategic framing
**AI Role**: Parallel research execution, source gathering, evidence compilation

**Results**: 200+ sources across six domains, comprehensive 35-page synthesis, completed in 1 day

## Key Insights

### 🎯 UIUC's Competitive Advantage
- **Proven models**: 14 CS+X programs (9+ years), 4 X+DS programs
- **Infrastructure**: $270M AI funding, DeltaAI, IBM-Illinois
- **Faculty expertise**: World-class researchers across disciplines
- **Online experience**: Successful MCS-DS demonstrates scalability

### 🚀 Opportunity for National Leadership
- Most peer universities launched AI minors 2024-2025 (recent trend)
- X+AI blended degrees barely exist nationally
- UIUC positioned to lead with dual-track + stackable credentials
