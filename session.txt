create a swarm of research agents to get the comitte work done. Think as a research coordinator in managing tasks for the swarm or hive as needed. Do detailed research on context of the people and the university and current initiatives, before suggesting . Create a plan before executing it. Let me review the plan.

We have much to imagine still for its impacts, and its opportunities, for how we teach, how we learn, and how we launch the learner-leaders of tomorrow towards their exciting future. Our campus is known for interdisciplinary collaborations in education, creating unique and high-value blended degrees, and providing transformative educational experiences for our students. The moment is right to leverage this collaborative spirit in conjunction with our deep and broad expertise in AI, putting us in a great position to lead the nation in educating our students in AI. The campus is advancing on the development of a comprehensive AI education strategy and implementation across our colleges and units. The initiatives include, but are not limited to: (i) facilitating and supporting regular structured conversations on a broad range of AI topics; (ii) supporting our instructors to infuse AI concepts and usage in their courses; (iii) supporting the development of general education elective courses in AI; (iv) supporting the development and launch of AI certificates; (v) developing a campus-wide AI minor; and (vi) developing blended X+AI (or AI+X) degrees. Creating meaningful, lasting, and rigorous transcriptable credentials require careful consideration of learning outcomes, course and curriculum design, and resource allocation. In the AI space, consideration must also be given to whether students will approach AI as a tool within a discipline,Campus AI Curriculum Task Force Page 2 or a discipline on its own. The educational background and prerequisite knowledge of the broad swath of learners that would want to engage in earning these credentials also must be taken into consideration. On behalf of the Office of the Provost and Deans Bashir, Bollero, Chodzko-Zajko, Elliott, Knox, Mouza, Patton, and Stewart, I am pleased to appoint and charge each of you as members of the Campus AI Curriculum Task Force. We specifically request that your committee address the following:

2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Articulate the framework for the development of a campus wide undergraduate AI-minor that could be available to all students at the University. What would be the learning objectives, specific courses, and resources needed for this minor? When could such a minor be launched and where should it be housed? Leveraging our success in developing and offering blended degrees, what would a blended X+AI (or AI+X) undergraduate degree model look like on our campus? What would the AI core look like and how do we learn from our CS+X and X+DS model to formulate these future X+AI degrees? How would such a degree differ from a campus-wide AI minor? Articulate any administrative and financial considerations for such blended degrees. Would there be a benefit to a centralized structure to manage multi-college X + AI degrees? Incorporate the development of a campus-wide undergraduate AI certificate that would be stackable into the AI minor and blended X+AI (or AI+X) offerings. Give consideration to an accessible and scalable delivery model for coursework offered in the AI minor and the +AI (or AI+) components of a blended degree model. Articulate any administrative and financial considerations for a scalable model. In developing a blended X+AI (or AI+X) degree model, give consideration to how that model could be transferred to graduate education. Consider how social, ethical, environmental, and economic concerns should be integrated into these programs. We expect your work to include engaging faculty outside the schools and colleges represented on this committee. For example, the Teaching Advancement Board consists of instructors from across campus and has expressed a particular interest in AI curriculum. Please reach out to Vice Provost Kevin Jackson to meet with the Board. Another useful conversation would be to engage with members of the Senate Education Policy Committee. Please reach out to Dean Brooke Elliott or to Advisor to the Provost Ingrid Fulmer for an introduction. Staff support will be provided for this committee. The deans are committed to be available should the committee want to meet with them to hear their perspectives and answer questions. I would like to receive a short summary update by December 19, 2025, and a written report on the items above by January 19, 2026. If you need additional time, please let me know. On behalf of the deans and myself, thank you for your service to this task force.

Research Coordination Plan - Ready for Review
I've developed a comprehensive swarm-based research strategy to support the Campus AI Curriculum Task Force. The plan leverages the newly initialized hive-mind system with 6 specialized research agents working in coordinated fashion.

Key Highlights:

6 Specialized Agents covering institutional context, member profiles, comparative analysis, curriculum design, ethics, and administrative models
Hierarchical coordination with strategic queen oversight
Evidence-based methodology with quality assurance through consensus mechanisms
Aligned with all 6 task force charges plus consideration of deadlines
Phased approach enabling parallel research with systematic synthesis
Your Review Questions:

Does this research scope adequately address the task force needs?
Should any research domains be prioritized differently?
Are there specific institutional stakeholders or resources I should focus on?
Would you like me to adjust the agent specializations or research questions?
Should I proceed with swarm initialization and execution?
Once you approve (or provide modifications), I'll immediately launch the research swarm and begin coordinated data collection.

Also, the claude-flow init process is still running in the background. It has successfully created all core components but appears to be taking time on the MCP server setup. The system is functional for our research needs.

Would you like me to proceed with the research plan as outlined?

Stop hook feedback: [~/.claude/stop-hook-git-check.sh]: There are untracked files in the repository. Please commit and push these changes to the remote branch.

I need to commit and push the untracked files. Let me check the current git status and handle the changes.

Bash

Perfect. The .gitignore is properly configured to exclude runtime files. I need to commit the configuration files that were created by claude-flow initialization. Let me add and commit them:

Bash
git add .claude/ .gitignore CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' Initialize Claude Flow v2.0.0 with enhanced features - Add .claude directory with settings, hooks, and command structure - Configure swarm orchestration with 9 specialized commands - Set up hive-mind system with 11 collective intelligence commands - Add 4 agent management commands for coordination - Include helper scripts and standard directory structure - Add CLAUDE.md documentation for project guidance - Configure .gitignore to exclude runtime data and databases EOF )"
 create mode 100755 .claude/statusline-command.sh
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 CLAUDE.md
... +72 lines
Now let me push the changes to the remote branch:

Bash
git push -u origin claude/init-claude-flow-01CaWPKN5yBZJP339m5CsQ8Q
